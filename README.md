## Personal Website Project

This project is a personal website built using Quarto and [hosted via GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)

Inspiration for the structure comes from Louise Sinks, who made a [helpful post](https://lsinks.github.io/posts/2023-11-01-website-building/website.html) about the process of building a personal website on her blog. I followed the references she recommended for setting up and hosting the project, and borrowed her blog structure for creating my own list of personal projects.
